/**
   A cash register totals up sales and computes change due.

   Version for CS 455 lab 3.  Modified from version from Big Java, 6th
   ed.

   Changes [made by CMB]:

     * This version of the class is called CashReg (instead of CashRegister)
     * Added getTotal() accessor function.
     *  Made constants private.

   Ex:
   CashReg register = new CashReg();
   register.recordPurchase(0.59);  // ring something up
   register.recordPurchase(1.99);  // ring up another item
   register.recordPurchase(5.0);   // ring up a third item
   double tot = register.getTotal();    // total of purchases so far: 7.58
   register.receivePayment(10,0,0,0,0);  // customer pays with a 10
   int change = register.giveChange();  // compute change owed: 2.42
                                        // and zeroes out register

   register.recordPurchase(1.0);  // now we start ringing up someone else . . .
